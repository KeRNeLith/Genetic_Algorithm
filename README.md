GA_And_Robot
=================

The final goal of the project is to use specifics algorithms like Genetic Algorithms (GA)
and Multi Objectives Optimization Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II).

- It provide a base implementation of Single Objective Genetic Algorithm with 
Roulette Wheel Selection.
=> An example to show how to use it is available.

- It provide a base implementation of Multi Objectives Optimization Genetic Algorithm with 
Crowded Tournament Selection.
